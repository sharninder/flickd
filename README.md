## flickd

### flickr downloader

This script lets you download all the photos in your set to your local computer.

I know there are a million scripts out there that already do this, but let's just say this was an itch that needed to be scratched.

You need an api key to run this script. You can generate one for yourself from http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/?

Add the api key and secret to config.yaml and you're set. Run with ruby flickd.rb
